<p>welcome. i&rsquo;m <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shusheaan/">Shu</a>. glad you came.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;non sunt multiplicanda entia sine necessitate.&rdquo;</em> i believe in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor">occam&rsquo;s razor</a>, so i built this site in the simplest way possible to only show the essentials for you to know about me, all the cool things i&rsquo;m into, and, hopefully, to discover any resemblance between us, so that we could be friends.</p>

<p>life is so short, therefore i try to spend my time <em>in my own way</em> by experiencing different forms of &ldquo;being a human&rdquo;: as a mathematician, an engineer, a programmer, a skater, a snowboarder, a guitar player, a producer, a traveler, and so many others. i&rsquo;m actively exploring my interests and various new things, and refuse to settle with anything, even those i&rsquo;ve been always good at.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;cyaned&rdquo;</em> comes from <span style="color:cyan;">cyan</span>, the color of shallow water over a sandy beach, and the independent record label of <a href="https://blonded.co/">frank ocean</a> (&ldquo;blonded&rdquo;) - he&rsquo;s inspired me so much and taught me how to be honest with myself and not give a damn about people&rsquo;s judges.</p>

<p>now, maybe it&rsquo;s better to spread things out a bit so you can walk around on this spacy canvas and see if anything catches you.</p>

<h2 id="musical-visual">musical &amp; visual</h2>

<p>music has always been the backbone of my energy - i need good tracks much more than a morning coffee shot. my interests cover a <em>wide</em> range of sounds, including jazz, blues, contemporary r&amp;b, electronic, indie rock, and ambient.</p>

<p>i was raised in a family of western pop music fans, and in early years of college i started to make my own recordings and productions inspired by kanye west, frank ocean, and justin vernon. since 2019 i started to learn jazz guitar and have gone almost completely old-school by filling all of my spare time with 60&rsquo;s/70&rsquo;s jazz and blues live sessions by wes montgomery, charlie parker, thelonious monk and so many other greatests.</p>

<p>i really enjoy playing electric guitar and synthesizer - i have an ocean blue <a href="https://www.ibanez.com/usa/products/model/s/">ibanez s-series</a> and a pearl white <a href="https://shop.fender.com/en-US/electric-guitars/stratocaster/">fender strat</a>. in terms of music tech, my fav has always been <a href="https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/">logic pro</a>, <a href="https://lilypond.org/">lilypond</a>, and <a href="https://sonic-pi.net/">sonic pi</a>.</p>

<p>i&rsquo;m also very interested in combining soundtracks with visual productions - i usually do experiments with anime re-edits fitting the vibe of my own re-mixes. one recent example <a href="../assets/films/somewhere.mp4">here</a>, in which visuals are originate from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Your_Name">&ldquo;your name&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<h2 id="programming-hacking">Programming &amp; Hacking</h2>

<p>I code, for a living and for fun, as a devout disciple in the immortal <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/why-gnu-linux.html">GNU/Linux</a> community. Technically I&rsquo;m still a newbie - I stayed in macOS until my graduation from MIT - that was such a pity as <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/">MIT-CSAIL</a> stands at the very center of the GNU world and hacker culture, I felt guilty I didn&rsquo;t get Linux (if not <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a>) installed the moment I first stepped into the Cambridge tech heaven. I tried to catch up, and now all of my computing devices are running Linux (with different distros though) and I feel better and <em>more love</em> everyday.</p>

<p>I was never a geek. I got my first personal laptop (a ThinkPad T60 powered by Windows XP) when I was 12, and I did <em>everything</em> but coding at that time (still technically challenging though, like cracking bootleg <a href="https://pmdg.com/">PMDG</a> and <a href="https://www.aerosoft.com/us/">Aerosoft</a> plug-ins on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/314160/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator_X_Steam_Edition/">FSX</a>) - there&rsquo;s no engineer in my family, nobody told me how beautiful and fun coding could get. After completely giving up on Windows Vista due to its terrible performance and design, I switched to macOS and finally started to code in Python and C++ for course projects in statistical analysis and testing simple trading strategies. At that time, writing scripts and classes in IDEs seemed pretty terrifying and the CLI was just like hell to me. Programming was neither enjoyable nor fun to me - until I learned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)">vim</a> (if you are an emacs user, can we shake hands first?).</p>

<p>Using vim was <em>the</em> milestone where coding suddenly turned from a serious and tedious job to a real joy to me. I quickly got addicted to it and couldn&rsquo;t stop exploring more tips, tricks, and fancy plug-ins. After vim and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb">vimium</a> completely taking over my texting and browsing, I couldn&rsquo;t remember how life was back when I used a mouse to click around to debug and was not enjoying programming at all.</p>

<p>Naturally, as I went further down the road, I couldn&rsquo;t get enough with the customizability of macOS, therefore I switched - it&rsquo;s funny but true - boosting productivity was not the main motivation for me to go for Linux, it was the god-like ability/freedom to build and custom <em>anything</em> you want in your system. &ldquo;As you wish&rdquo; is the <em>most sexy sentence</em> anything could possibly say.</p>

<p>I have both Arch-based and Debian-based machines serving as my daily drivers at the same time - honestly, normally I just don&rsquo;t feel much difference, though pacman is indeed faster and smoother (and the rolling system is of course much sexier), apt is good enough for me and sometimes I rather go for stability when I just want to enjoy my coffee. My terminal experience is powered by zsh, ranger, and several other cool CLI tools - they are all very elegantly designed and nurtured by the ethernal open-source community. As a total minimalist and simplist, I also quitted DE completely - GNOME and KDE Plasma look awesome, but they just have too much calorie for me - most of the time I only stay in terminal and Chrome held by a fully customized <a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3wm</a>. All of my systems are <em>extremely</em> lightweight and usually take &lt;500MB of RAM in idle. If you feel like we are on the same boat (even if you are using emacs), feel free to check out my <a href="https://github.com/hughshuwang/grwm">dotfile repo</a> and other toy hacks on my <a href="https://github.com/hughshuwang">GitHub</a>. If you have a dotfile repo, please share it with me!</p>

<p>In my fulltime job, I code in Python and R for Quant Research in Portfolio Optimization and Machine Learning. In my spare time, I code for fun and make things easier in my life. Usually, I can get things going with Python, Julia, and zsh scripts. I&rsquo;m now very into Edge AI and messing with some cool hardware and dev-boards like <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/">RPi 4B</a> and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-xavier-nx/">Jetson Xavier NX</a>. Recently, with the help of a <a href="https://coral.ai/products/accelerator">Google Coral TPU</a>, I successfully made an <a href="https://github.com/hughshuwang/kbos">automatic DSLR module</a> that can take high-res photos for aircrafts flying by around my apartment by itself. This is merely a laziness-driven project, manual aviation photography is tiring, but who can resist to let a <a href="https://www.klm.com/travel/us_en/prepare_for_travel/on_board/our_aircraft/airbus_a330_300.htm">KLM A333</a> fly away without giving that beauty a shot?</p>

<h2 id="mathematics-research">Mathematics &amp; Research</h2>

<p>Since childhood, I was a contester, always competing with older kids. I was in China team in Asia-Pacific Mathematical Olympics. Olympics, first Math then Physics.</p>

<p>In college went for quant finance, still enjoy math lessons the most.</p>

<p>At MIT, dive deeper in portfolio management and asset allocation theories, as well as OR and modern optimization techniques.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;m focusing on large-scale optimization for cutting-edge portfolio management.</p>
