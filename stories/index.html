I don't deserve anything from you." <br>
"..." <br>
"I had already given up on myself. I was so lost." <br>
"I knew, that's why I kept finding you." <br>
"I'm so sorry I hung up all of your calls." <br>

(i) Be completely open, don't judge, <br>
try to comprehend the purpose inside first <br>
(ii) Patiently stay focus right on the main track, <br>
while paying attention to production details <br>
(iii) Create a visual environment with feelings,<br>
actively search and link life memories <br>

In the Tokyo vlog by edocolala, Cola was saying: <br>
"Even in such a huge, busy city, we can't really speed up, <br>
we just wander around, use our cameras to record moments. <br>
There's no plan for our travel, we just follow our feelings. <br>
Everyone is rushing, but we still try to slow it down." <br>
<br>
Simply watching this made me cry. <br>
I was rushing my life too much, <br>
way too much. <br>

It's the video of Shaun White <br>
winning the half pipe gold in Olympics 2018 <br>
Full 100 seconds close-up before his epic performance, <br>
the host was saying "Shaun White, the biggest run in his life."<br>
I can see his eyes, his face, as he's preparing for the last run.<br>
All of a sudden, I got the whole idea of it: <br>
<br>
In all of the greatest moments by the greatest people, <br>
the underlying core is not mysterious or complicated at all. <br>
All they had in mind was just a simple will, a straight focus. <br>
The hardness and toughness only happened behind the scene. <br>
We will never know. <br>

Everyone has something to respect, admire, and love. <br>
Everything has something to thank, appreciate, and cherish. <br> 
Live is self-salvation, not self-abasement or self-abandonment. <br> 
To be good to yourself is the only advice.<br>
<br>
Nobody will win forever <br>
and nobody will lose forever. <br> 
We all have our own time zones, <br>
there's no such a thing called falling behind.<br> 
The gods have special paths prepared for each of us.<br>
<br>
No rush. <br>
The greedy illusion is our only weakness.<br>
<br>

3 A.M., someday in November 2012, <br>
Peking University, Beijing, China <br>
The last night before leaving Beijing, <br>
heading to the CPhO national final in Jilin. <br>
Ydz, who's also a national finalist 3 years prior to me, <br>
was at Tsinghua earning his degree in CS and microelectronics, <br>
ended his speech with the last sentence: <br>
<br>
<b>"If you know you CAN do it, <br>
you MUST do it RIGHT."</b>
<br><br>
He's the one who inspired me to appreciate science and technology <br>
in a way that's the same as how we appreciate sex <br>
