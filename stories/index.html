In the Tokyo vlog by edocolala, Cola was saying: <br>
"Even in such a huge, busy city, we can't really speed up, <br>
we just wander around, use cameras to record beautiful moments. <br>
There's no plan for everyday's travel, we just follow our feelings. <br>
That day on the beach, all we remember is just the nice weather, <br>
and feeling absolutely comfortable with each other. <br>
Everyone is rushing, but we still try to slow it down." <br>
<br>
Simply watching this made me cry. <br>
I was rushing my life too much, <br>
way too much. <br>

A good function should never be more than 50 lines <br>
A good project should never contain a "rotten" function <br>
Always draft and clearify the system on paper before coding<br>
Always be prepared for massive structual changes <br>
Always avoid stinking loops and redundant variables <br>
Always think both as a mathematician and an engineer <br>
<br>
- a short note on personal view of elegant problem solving

It's the video of Shaun White winning the half pipe gold in Olympics 2018 <br>
Full 100 seconds close-up before his epic performance, the host was saying <br>
"Shaun White, the biggest run in his life right now."<br>
I can see his eyes, his face, as he's preparing for the last run.<br>
All of a sudden, I got the whole idea of it: <br>
<br>
In all of the greatest moments by the greatest people, <br>
the underlying core is not mysterious or complicated at all. <br>
All they had in mind was just a simple will, a straight focus. <br>
The hardness and toughness only happened behind the scene. <br>
We will never know. <br>

Everyone has something to respect, admire, and love. <br>
Everything has something to thank, appreciate, and cherish. <br> 
Live is self-salvation, not self-abasement or self-abandonment. <br> 
To be good to yourself is the only advice.<br>
<br>
Nobody will win forever and nobody will lose forever. <br> 
We all have our own time zones, there's no such a thing called falling behind.<br> 
The gods have special paths prepared for each of us; no rush. <br>
The greedy illusion is our only weakness.<br>
<br>

3 A.M., someday in November 2012, Peking University, Beijing, China <br>
The last night before leaving Beijing, heading to the CPhO national final in Jilin. <br>
Ydz, who's also a national finalist in CPhO 3 years prior to me, was at Tsinghua <br>
earning his Bachelor's degree in computer science and microelectronics, <br>
ended his speech with the last sentence: <br>
<br>
<b>"If you know you CAN do it, <br>
you MUST do it RIGHT."</b>
<br><br>
He's the one who inspired me to appreciate science and technology <br>
in a way that's the same as how we appreciate sex <br>
