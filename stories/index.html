<p>‚Äúi will immerse myself, <br>
and as I do, i will slowly shut down my higher brain functions, <br>
un-making myself, leaving just enough to appreciate my surroundings <br>
to extract <b> some simple pleasure from the execution of a task well-done. </b> <br>
my search for truth is finished at last. <br>
<b> i‚Äôm going home.‚Äù </b> <br>

<p>welcome! it&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shusheaan/">Shu</a>. glad you came.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;non sunt multiplicanda entia sine necessitate.&rdquo;</em> i believe in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor">occam&rsquo;s razor</a>, so i built this site in the simplest way possible to only show the essentials for you to know about myself, all the cool things i&rsquo;m into, and, hopefully, to discover any resemblance between us, so that we could be friends.</p>

<p>life is so short, so i try to spend my time <em>in my own way</em> by experiencing different forms of &ldquo;being a human&rdquo;: as a mathematician, an engineer, a programmer, a skater, a snowboarder, a guitar player, a producer, a traveler, and so many others. i&rsquo;m actively exploring my interests and new things, and refuse to settle with anything, even those i&rsquo;ve been always good at.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;cyaned&rdquo;</em> comes from <span style="color:cyan;">cyan</span>, the color of shallow water over a sandy beach, and the independent record label of <a href="https://blonded.co/">frank ocean</a> (&ldquo;blonded&rdquo;) - he&rsquo;s inspired me so much and taught me how to be honest with myself.</p>

<p>now, maybe it&rsquo;s better to spread things out a bit so you can walk around on this spacy canvas and see if anything catches you.</p>

<h2 id="musical-visual">musical &amp; visual</h2>

<p>music has always been the backbone of my energy - i need good tracks much more than a morning coffee shot. my interests cover a <em>wide</em> range of sounds, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music">classical</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz">jazz</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues">blues</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_R%26B">contemporary r&amp;b</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_music">electronic</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_rock">indie rock</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_music">ambient</a>.</p>

<p>i was raised in a family of western pop music fans, and in early years of college i started to make my own recordings and productions inspired by <a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/">kanye west</a>, <a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/29508-frank-ocean/">frank ocean</a>, and <a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/5471-bon-iver/">justin vernon</a>. since 2019 i&rsquo;ve started to learn jazz guitar and gone almost completely old-school, filling all of my spare time with 70s jazz and blues live sessions by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Montgomery">wes montgomery</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Parker">charlie parker</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelonious_Monk">thelonious monk</a> and so many other greatests.</p>

<p>i enjoy playing electric guitar and synthesizer - i have a pearl white <a href="https://shop.fender.com/en-US/electric-guitars/stratocaster/">fender strat</a> and an ocean blue <a href="https://www.ibanez.com/usa/products/model/s/">ibanez s-series</a>. in terms of music tech, my fav has always been <a href="https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/">logic pro</a>, <a href="https://lilypond.org/">lilypond</a>, and <a href="https://sonic-pi.net/">sonic pi</a>.</p>

<p>i&rsquo;m also very into combining soundtracks with visual productions - i do experiments with anime re-edits and my own soundtrack re-mixes. one recent example <a href="../assets/films/somewhere.mp4">üìπ</a>, in which visuals originate from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Your_Name">&ldquo;your name&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<h2 id="programming-hacking">programming &amp; hacking</h2>

<p>i code, for a living and for fun, as a devout disciple in the immortal <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/why-gnu-linux.html">gnu/linux</a> community. all of my computing devices are running linux - i feel more love everyday from the fsf and open-source community.</p>

<p>when i&rsquo;m with my silicon pals, i only need two things: a terminal and a browser. i do all of my output-oriented tasks in <a href="https://www.vim.org/">vim</a>, along with a bundle of cool cli tools, from coding to writing notes, from email to file management. i love the feeling of directly talking to my machine thru texts and commands. any task with graphics involved? chrome is more than enough.</p>

<p>i keep everything lightweight and simplistic, so i&rsquo;m not a floating windows guy - i can only take <a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3wm</a> or stay in the full-screen mode to be comfortable and productive. i customize as many things as possible in my digital world and maintain my personal system setup in this <a href="https://github.com/hughshuwang/grwm">dotfile repo</a>, and as you might have guessed, i use a customized <a href="https://www.hhkeyboard.com/uk/products/pro2/">hhkb pro2</a>, and i think it&rsquo;s the one, for life.</p>

<p>coding is full of joy to me. i write python and r in my full-time job solving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness">np-hard</a> mathematical problems. in my spare time i do julia and ruby for toy projects, also build some interesting diy hard-ware, like a camera taking airplane photos by itself powered by a rpi4 and a coral tpu (see <a href="https://github.com/hughshuwang/kbos">here</a>).</p>

<p><a id="research"></a></p>

<h2 id="mathematics-research">mathematics &amp; research</h2>

<p>ever since i could remember, i&rsquo;ve been addicted to solving math problems (and crushing other kids mentally :D). when i was 11, i got selected in the china national team for asia-pacific math olympiad (for primary school students of course lol). not a big deal but it was the only global contest i even attended. since then i realized that it might actually be something i can make a living from.</p>

<p>before college, i competed in all major national olympiad contests in china, and i finally got accepted by <a href="http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/">jiao tong university</a> (the so-called eastern mit) by winning top 150 in national physics olympiad. it&rsquo;s a breath-taking journey teaching me so many life lessons, like how to push myself to the limit, how to wisely manage my time, absolute self-control, exploiting my full potential, and grinding for it.</p>

<p>i study quant finance and economics in college and keep up the momentum at <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/">mit sloan</a>. here in the cambridge geek heaven i grew a lot of interests in operations research and math optimization due to their similar nature to solving a physical system. now i&rsquo;m focusing on large-scale optimization problems in real-world applications, mostly in an investment management context - &ldquo;how to find the best portfolio to invest in the fastest way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>as many other tech fanatics, i&rsquo;m also very into machine learning and artificial intelligence. i use <a href="https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning">pytorch-lightning</a> and do <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">kaggle</a> occasionally with my best friends, but i&rsquo;d say that&rsquo;s more like execution than creation.</p>

<p><a id="skate"></a></p>

<h2 id="skateboarding-snowboarding">skateboarding &amp; snowboarding</h2>

<p>i consider myself as &ldquo;somewhat talented in sports&rdquo;, and i tried many of them. from the experience i have, snowboarding and skateboarding are undoubtedly the two hardest subjects. to me they are not just entertainment, but the mental training i&rsquo;ve been lacking for so long in my life.</p>

<p>my first time snowboarding dated back to 2018, in louise lake, banff national park - the stunning view set up my first impression for snowboarding. since then i&rsquo;ve been training every week as long as there&rsquo;s some good snow around. i began with duck stance and a park twin board, then i switched to directional snow surfing inspired by <a href="http://kotsugai-naoto.blogspot.com/">kotsugai naoto</a> - now i&rsquo;m riding a forward stance of (30, 12) with a powder special edition of <a href="https://www.arborcollective.com/collections/featured-snowboards/products/clovis-21">arbor clovis 157</a> (see my maintenance routine <a href="../assets/films/clovis.MP4">üìπ</a>).</p>

<p>as simplistic i am in tech world, i&rsquo;m naturally fascinated by the experience of floating in a raw and pure world covered with white powder and fluffy bubbles. even the trip to ski resort itself is enjoyable enough - i can&rsquo;t express how much i love the sense of escaping from the noisy modern world and being able to hear myself clearly.</p>

<p>skateboarding is another story - it&rsquo;s just a pure mental game. there&rsquo;s an unimaginably huge hump at the beginning; riding down the road, cruising through traffics, and jumping ollies can already intimidate so many beginners, simply because they&rsquo;re, just, too, hard. the risk and return of each attempt when learning a new trick is just so disproportionate that everything else in life, all of a sudden, appears to be so easy and chill.</p>

<p>having said that, the day you got your first kickflip will indeed be the best day of your life. trust me.</p>
