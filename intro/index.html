<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>

<p>Welcome. I&rsquo;m <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shusheaan/">Shu</a>. Glad you came.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Non sunt multiplicanda entia sine necessitate.&rdquo; I believe in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor">Occam&rsquo;s Razor</a>, so I built this site in the simplest way possible to only show the essentials for you to know about me, all the cool things I&rsquo;m into, and, hopefully, to discover any resemblance between us, so that we could be friends.</p>

<p>Life is short, so I try to spend my time wisely, and look forward to experiencing different forms of &ldquo;being a human&rdquo;: as a mathematician, an engineer, a programmer, a dancer, a singer, a photographer, a novelist, a guitar player, a producer, a traveler, a snowboarder, and so many others. I&rsquo;m actively exploring my interests and refuse to settle with anything, even those I&rsquo;ve been always good at.</p>

<p>The name <em>&ldquo;CYANED&rdquo;</em> comes from <span style="color:cyan;">cyan</span>, the color of shallow water over a sandy beach, and the independent record label of <a href="https://blonded.co/">Frank Ocean</a> (<em>BLONDED</em>) - he&rsquo;s the inspiration of all my creativity and the one who taught me how to be honest with myself.</p>

<p>Now, maybe it&rsquo;s better to spread things out a bit so you can walk around on this spacy canvas and see if anything catches you.</p>

<h2 id="musical-visual">Musical &amp; Visual</h2>

<p>Music has always been the backbone of my energy - I need good tracks much more than a morning coffee shot. My interests cover a <em>wide</em> range of sounds, from the old-school Jazz by <a href="https://www.keithjarrett.org/">Keith Jarrett</a> to the most aggressive experimental by <a href="https://arca1000000.com/">Arca</a>, but in general, I focus mainly on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_R%26B">Contemporary R&amp;B</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock">Alternative Rock</a>, which I also learn to comprehend further and write some of my own.</p>

<p>I was raised in a family of western pop music fans - in my dad&rsquo;s study room there are tons of vinyl records and CDs by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jackson">Michael Jackson</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna">Madonna</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles">The Beetles</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagles_(band)">Eagles</a>, and on the DVD player screen on his old S-class, the legendary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_in_Bucharest:_The_Dangerous_Tour">Bucharest Concert</a> was played more than hundreds of times, if not thousands - that&rsquo;s also where I learned some of MJ&rsquo;s iconic moves (i.e. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znQKReYjWgI">Billie Jean Solo</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6pomaq30Gg">Moon Walk</a>) and performed them in front of thousands of audiences in my high school and college.</p>

<p>The golden time of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance-pop">Dance Pop</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo_soul">Neo Soul</a> marked my childhood and adolescence. In college I was then greatly inspired by <a href="https://www.kanyewest.com/">Kanye West</a> (like Elon Musk) and started to fall in love with modern music production techniques. With the splendid production of <em>the one and only</em> <a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14880-my-beautiful-dark-twisted-fantasy/">MBDTF</a> teaching me how soundtracks should be created and polished, the alternative classic <a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22295-blonde-endless/">Blonde/Endless</a> opened a whole new world of making emotional bond between the artist and the audiences. Now to me music creation is more than showing off complex chord progressions - it&rsquo;s &ldquo;feeling each other by hearts&rdquo;.</p>

<p>My idea of integrating musical experience with visual arts originally came from the luxuriant <a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/5471-bon-iver/">Bon Iver</a> - they use splendid visual arts to magnify the joy brought by their extremely well-crafted tracks. Therefore, besides making Dream Pop snippets, I&rsquo;m also exploring ways of combining video cuts with songs - a glimpse of my work below (links provided for non-original elements).</p>

<p>I play electric guitar, keyboard, and mess with synthesizers a bit. In terms of music tech, my fav has always been <a href="https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/">Logic</a>, <a href="https://lilypond.org/">LilyPond</a>, and <a href="https://sonic-pi.net/">Sonic Pi</a>. I&rsquo;m now working on a mixtape/EP under the project name &ldquo;C2CY&rdquo; (pronouced as &ldquo;see both sides&rdquo;).

<h2 id="programming-hacking">Programming &amp; Hacking</h2>

<p>I code, for a living and for fun, as a devout disciple in the immortal <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/why-gnu-linux.html">GNU/Linux</a> community. Technically I&rsquo;m still a newbie - I stayed in macOS until my graduation from MIT - that was such a pity as MIT-CSAIL stands at the very center of the GNU world and hacker culture, I felt guity I didn&rsquo;t get Linux (if not <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a>) installed the moment I first stepped into the Cambridge tech heaven. So I was trying to catch up, and now all of my computing devices, except for the mobile bricks iPhone and iPad, are running Linux (with different distros though) and I feel better everyday.</p>

<p>I was never a geek. I got my first personal laptop (a ThinkPad T60 powered by Windows XP) when I was 12, and I did <em>everything</em> but coding at that time - there&rsquo;s no engineer in my family, nobody told me how beautiful and fun coding could possibly get. After completely giving up on Windows Vista (now I kind of thank its incredibly poor performance and design, not UX but system design, so that I successfully escaped), I switched to macOS with a 11&rsquo; MacBook Air. That was such a well-made machine, and I started to customize it - simple things like adding fancy tools in the menu bar and remapping keys. As a Unix-like system, macOS really gave me a relief and showed me the bright side of computers.</p>

<p>After <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)">vim</a> (if you are an emacs user, can we shake hands first?) and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb">vimium</a> completely taking over my texting and browsing, I couldn&rsquo;t get enough with the customizability of macOS, and then I switched - it&rsquo;s funny but also true - boosting productivity was not the main motivation for me to switch to Linux, but the god-like ability to build and custom <em>anything</em> you want in your system. &ldquo;As you wish&rdquo; is the <em>most sexy sentence</em> anything could possibly say.</p>

<p>You can tell my lifestyle based on my <code>neofetch</code> outputs:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Arch Linux / Debian Buster 10 / PopOS 20.04 LTS</li>
<li><strong>Shell</strong>: zsh 5.8 (powered by oh-my-zsh with custom themes)</li>
<li><strong>WM</strong>: i3 (came from GNOME3 and KDE Plasma but now I wanna KISS)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you feel like we are on the same boat (even you are using emacs), feel free to check out my <a href="https://github.com/hughshuwang/grwm">dotfile repo</a> and other toy hacks on my <a href="https://github.com/hughshuwang">GitHub</a>. If you have a dotfile repo, please share!</p>

<p>In my fulltime job, I code in Python and R for Quant Research in Portfolio Optimization and Machine Learning. In my spare time, I code for fun and make things easier in my life. I&rsquo;m now very into Edge AI and messing with cool hardware and dev-boards like <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/">RPi 4B</a> and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-xavier-nx/">Jetson Xavier NX by Nvidia</a>. Recently, with the help of <a href="https://coral.ai/products/accelerator">Google Coral TPU</a>, I successfully made an <a href="https://github.com/hughshuwang/kbos">automatic DSLR module</a> that can take high-res photos of aircrafts flying by around my apartment for me. You know, who can let a <a href="https://www.klm.com/travel/us_en/prepare_for_travel/on_board/our_aircraft/airbus_a330_300.htm">KLM A333</a> go without taking a photo of that beauty?</p>
