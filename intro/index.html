<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>

<p>Welcome. I&rsquo;m <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shusheaan/">Shu</a>. Glad you came.</p>

<p>I believe in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor">Occam&rsquo;s Razor</a>, so I tried to build this site in the simplest way possible, and only show the essentials for you to know about myself, all the cool things I&rsquo;m into, and, hopefully, to discover any resemblance between us, so that we could be friends.</p>

<p>You might ask, why this name <em>&ldquo;CYANED&rdquo;</em> instead of a more straightforward <em>&ldquo;The Portfolio of Shu Shean&rdquo;</em>? It&rsquo;s simple, <span style="color:cyan;">cyan</span>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyan">greenish blue</a>, is my favourite color. As mentioned in Wikipedia, it&rsquo;s <em>the color of shallow water over a sandy beach</em>, and it&rsquo;s the color of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranus">Uranus</a>. The &lsquo;ed&rsquo; suffix comes from the name of the official and record label of <a href="https://blonded.co/">Frank Ocean</a> (<em>BLONDED.CO</em>) - he&rsquo;s the legend I always look up to, the inspiration of all my creativity, the one taught me how to be myself and just don&rsquo;t give a shit about others.</p>

<p>Life is short, so I try to spend my time wisely, and look forward to experiencing different forms of &ldquo;being a human&rdquo;: as a mathematician, an engineer, a programmer, a dancer, a singer, a photographer, a novelist, a guitar player, a producer, a traveler, a snowboarder, and so many others. I&rsquo;m actively exploring my interests and refuse to settle with anything, even those I&rsquo;ve been always good at.</p>

<p>Now, maybe it&rsquo;s better to spread things out a bit so you can walk around on this spacy canvas and see if anything catches you.</p>

<h2 id="music">Music</h2>

<p>Music has always been the backbone of my energy - I need good tracks much more than a morning coffee shot. My interests cover a <em>wide</em> range of sounds, from the old-school Jazz by <a href="https://www.keithjarrett.org/">Keith Jarrett</a> to the most aggressive experimental by <a href="https://arca1000000.com/">Arca</a>, but in general, I focus mainly on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_R%26B">Contemporary R&amp;B</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_pop">Dream Pop</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock">Alternative Rock</a>, which are the genres I also learn to comprehend further and write some of my own.</p>

<p>I was raised in a family of western pop music fans - in my dad&rsquo;s study room there are tons of vinyl records and CDs by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jackson">Michael Jackson</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna">Madonna</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles">The Beetles</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagles_(band)">Eagles</a>, and on the CD player screen of his old S-class, the legendary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_in_Bucharest:_The_Dangerous_Tour">Bucharest Concert</a> had been played more than hundreds of times, if not thousands - that&rsquo;s also where I learned some of MJ&rsquo;s iconic moves (i.e. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znQKReYjWgI">Billie Jean Solo</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6pomaq30Gg">Moon Walk</a>) and performed them in front of thousands of audiences in my high school and college.</p>

<p>As I grew, there&rsquo;s always a group of cool friends keeping me updated on Billboard during the good old time of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance-pop">Dance Pop</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo_soul">Neo Soul</a>. From Lady Gaga to Britney Spears, from Neyo to Bruno Mars, their voices mark my childhood and adolescence.</p>

<p>In the first year of my college life, I went to Berkeley as an exchange student, then I got to attend my first concert in SF - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Run_Tour_(Beyonc%C3%A9_and_Jay-Z)">On The Run Tour by Beyonce and Jay-Z</a>, the tour series for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyonc%C3%A9_(album)"><em>BEYONCE</em></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_Carta_Holy_Grail"><em>MAGNA CARTA HOLY GRAIL</em></a>. This experience marked a new stage of my aesthetic journey, it awakened so many senses of mine about visual arts, design, music and movie production, even more about partners and love from the roleplay of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonnie_and_Clyde">Bonnie and Clyde</a> they presented. (To get a better sense of what I&rsquo;m talking about, I recommend you to check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8Qt1-P6dt4">150-sec short outro production</a>, with a custom remix of &ldquo;Bang Bang&rdquo; by Nancy Sinatra and &ldquo;Angels&rdquo; by The XX - it&rsquo;s the exemplar to follow every time I try to record and edit visual contents.)</p>

<p>Back from California, I then became a hip-hop guy, got greatly inspired by Kanye West just like Elon Musk - the <em>one and only</em> <a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14880-my-beautiful-dark-twisted-fantasy/"><em>MBDTF</em></a> taught me how to appreciate buffet-like beats and astonishing complicated and expensive productions - that was the time I started to be very into music theories and modern production techniques, and then rebuilt my understanding of how music is supposed to be made and polished.</p>

<p>Since then, I took music just like math and physics - something can be totally explained in a bullet-proof framework of theories and rules, and I thought music creation was nothing more than showing off complex chord progressions and highly convoluted harmony programming. Then, in the summer of 2016, Frank Ocean released the first independent project he&rsquo;s been working on for 4 years since 2012&rsquo;s <a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16859-channel-orange/"><em>Channel ORANGE</em></a> - <a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22295-blonde-endless/"><em>BLONDE/ENDLESS</em></a>: a project that can easily crash your emotions and make you not be able to cover in days. After months of heavy rotations, I realized that music is more about building connections between the artist and the audience - emotional bond usually dominates theories and techniques. Apparently, you need very mature craftmanship in sound manipulation and high-dimensional thinking, as well as some dame good ideas to be able to hit your audience, but there&rsquo;s still something more. Discovering such thing then became the impulse of me creating music.</p>

<p>I play electric guitar, keyboard, and mess with synthesizers a bit. In terms of music tech, my fav has always been <a href="https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/">Logic</a>, <a href="https://lilypond.org/">LilyPond</a>, and <a href="https://sonic-pi.net/">Sonic Pi</a>. I&rsquo;m now working on a mixtape/EP under the project name &ldquo;C2CY&rdquo;. For my work in music and media production in general, please see the channel <a href="https://cyaned.co/aesthetics/">&ldquo;Aesthetics&rdquo;</a>.</p>
