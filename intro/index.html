<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>

<p>Welcome. I&rsquo;m <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shusheaan/">Shu</a>. Glad you came.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Non sunt multiplicanda entia sine necessitate.&rdquo; I believe in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor">Occam&rsquo;s Razor</a>, so I built this site in the simplest way possible to only show the essentials for you to know about me, all the cool things I&rsquo;m into, and, hopefully, to discover any resemblance between us, so that we could be friends.</p>

<p>Life is short, so I try to spend my time wisely, and look forward to experiencing different forms of &ldquo;being a human&rdquo;: as a mathematician, an engineer, a programmer, a dancer, a singer, a photographer, a novelist, a guitar player, a producer, a traveler, a snowboarder, and so many others. I&rsquo;m actively exploring my interests and refuse to settle with anything, even those I&rsquo;ve been always good at.</p>

<p>The name <em>&ldquo;CYANED&rdquo;</em> comes from <span style="color:cyan;">cyan</span>, the color of shallow water over a sandy beach, and the independent record label of <a href="https://blonded.co/">Frank Ocean</a> (<em>BLONDED</em>) - he&rsquo;s the inspiration of all my creativity and the one who taught me how to be honest with myself.</p>

<p>Now, maybe it&rsquo;s better to spread things out a bit so you can walk around on this spacy canvas and see if anything catches you.</p>

<h2 id="musical-visual">Musical &amp; Visual</h2>

<p>Music has always been the backbone of my energy - I need good tracks much more than a morning coffee shot. My interests cover a <em>wide</em> range of sounds, from the old-school Jazz by <a href="https://www.keithjarrett.org/">Keith Jarrett</a> to the most aggressive experimental by <a href="https://arca1000000.com/">Arca</a>, but in general, I focus mainly on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_R%26B">Contemporary R&amp;B</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock">Alternative Rock</a>, which I also learn to comprehend further and write some of my own.</p>

<p>I was raised in a family of western pop music fans - in my dad&rsquo;s study room there are tons of vinyl records and CDs by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jackson">Michael Jackson</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna">Madonna</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles">The Beetles</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagles_(band)">Eagles</a>, and on the CD player screen of his old S-class, the legendary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_in_Bucharest:_The_Dangerous_Tour">Bucharest Concert</a> had been played more than hundreds of times, if not thousands - that&rsquo;s also where I learned some of MJ&rsquo;s iconic moves (i.e. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znQKReYjWgI">Billie Jean Solo</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6pomaq30Gg">Moon Walk</a>) and performed them in front of thousands of audiences in my high school and college.</p>

<p>The golden time of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance-pop">Dance Pop</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo_soul">Neo Soul</a> filled my childhood and adolescence. In college I was then greatly inspired by <a href="https://www.kanyewest.com/">Kanye West</a> (just like Elon Musk) and started to fall in love with modern music production techniques. With the splendid production of <em>the one and only</em> <a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14880-my-beautiful-dark-twisted-fantasy/">MBDTF</a> teaching me how soundtracks should be created and polished, the alternative classic <a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22295-blonde-endless/">Blonde/Endless</a> opened a whole new world of making emotional bond between the artist and the audiences. Now to me music creation is more than showing off complex chord progressions - it&rsquo;s more like &ldquo;feeling each other by hearts&rdquo;.</p>

<p>My idea of integrating musical experience with visual arts originally came from the luxuriant <a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/5471-bon-iver/">Bon Iver</a> - they use splendid visual arts to magnify the degree of joy brought by their extremely well-crafted tracks. Therefore, besides making Dream Pop snippets, I&rsquo;m also exploring ways of combining video cuts with songs - a glimpse of my original work below.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="../assets/films/fold.mp4"><strong>&ldquo;The Gyo-en Love Story&rdquo; (Short Ver.)</strong></a><br />
<strong>Musical</strong>: Outro of <strong>&ldquo;Fold (the Love)&rdquo;</strong><br />
<strong>Visual</strong>: Re-edit of <strong>&ldquo;The Garden of Words&rdquo;</strong></p></li>

<li><p><a href="../assets/films/somewhere.mp4"><strong>&ldquo;At the Mercy of You&rdquo; (Short Ver.)</strong></a><br />
<strong>Musical</strong>: Bridge of <strong>&ldquo;Deathwish (Remixed)&rdquo;</strong><br />
<strong>Visual</strong>: Re-edit of <strong>&ldquo;Your Name&rdquo;</strong></p></li>
</ul>

<p>I play electric guitar, keyboard, and mess with synthesizers a bit. In terms of music tech, my fav has always been <a href="https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/">Logic</a>, <a href="https://lilypond.org/">LilyPond</a>, and <a href="https://sonic-pi.net/">Sonic Pi</a>. I&rsquo;m now working on a mixtape/EP under the project name &ldquo;C2CY&rdquo; (pronouced as &ldquo;see both sides&rdquo;, including all songs shown above). For more details about my work in musical and visual production in general, please see the channel <a href="https://cyaned.co/channels/aesthetics/">&ldquo;Aesthetics&rdquo;</a>.</p>
